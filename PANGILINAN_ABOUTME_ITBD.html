	<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First and for most, I am Anthonet S. Pangilinan
		born on September 15, 2000 in Sta. Teresita General Hospital Quezon City. <sup>1</sup> I was the first born child of 
		my parents, Rona and Elmer Pangilinan. <sup>2</sup> My family has a lot of story whenever we talked about my childhood
		life. <sup>3</sup> Since I was a first born child, everybody seems to be excited when I came out to this world and
		eventually grew up as a very charming and active child inside and outside our home. <sup>4</sup> Back then, we used
		to live in a small neighbourhood and they always tell me that everyone living there is fond of carrying and playing
		with me.<sup>5</sup> I wasn’t the shy type of child and I remember dancing to the beat of the songs from the movie 
		Matilda since it was my favourite movie as a child. <sup>6</sup> My family would easily let me sing or dance during 
		our family gatherings.<sup>7</sup> I used to always get the spotlight and exposure when in fact, I was also featured 
		once in a kid's section of a local magazine where I said that I wanted to join the Little Miss Philippines.<sup>8</sup> 
		Growing up, I am very ambitious started when I was young and I have dreamed of a lot of things already. <sup>9</sup>
		Like the usual stories that you would ever hear from a child, I also dreamed of becoming a teacher, a doctor and an 
		architect. <sup>10</sup> I spent my childhood up until my junior high school days studying in a Catholic school where 
		I meet my childhood friends and there I started to learn not just knowledge in terms of academic but also in life. 
		<sup>11</sup> I was also a very active student in school and since then I always make sure to make my parents 
		proud of me. <sup>12</sup><br>
		
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My little sister came when I was 5 years old,
		I was so happy because I felt like I just had my sister and bestfriend all in one and now that we becaume older, I realized
		that I was indeed right by that thought.<sup>13</sup> Looking back, my childhood makes me think that everything is possible.<sup>14</sup>
		I barely fear doing a thing because I always knew that my parents and my family is right behind me.<sup>15</sup> My dreams doesn’t have any
		limits and I do not know how to worry back then.<sup>16</sup> Those days where you could just run freely on the streets and on the hallways 
		of the school and never bother the idea of falling. <sup>17</sup> I can say that I’ve had the best childhood years of my life. <sup>18</sup> 
		It was full of happiness and love from my family that’s something I would never forget and it is something I owe to my parents for 
		giving the best for me and raising me well.<sup>19</sup> I would always take the opportunity if given a chance to go back to it. <sup>20</sup>
		And I can proudly say that my childhood life is something that takes a big part of who I am today.<sup>21</sup>

		<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My teenage years was fun and here I slowly
		understand how the reality feels like. <sup>1</sup>Here I get to experience a deeper connection with the people around
		me and learn a lot from them.<sup>2</sup>It was this time of my life where I experienced my first international trip 
		with my family and it was also the same time I experienced going out of the country alone.<sup>3</sup> The experience 
		was amazing, to roam around the city you’re unfamiliar with and conquering it on your own was terrifying but so much 
		worth it at the same time.  <sup>4</sup> Teenage years is the stage of your life where you start to choose which 
		career path do you really want to pursue and in all honesty, it wasn’t easy.<sup>5</sup> After finishing junior high 
		school I really insist to spend my Senior High School in University Belt Manila because I felt that this is where I 
		could see the actual reality since it is out of my comfort zone.<sup>6</sup> I took up the STEM strand without knowing
		what I exactly want to pursue.<sup>7</sup> It’s just that I am torn between pursuing Information Technology and 
		Computer engineering although I am still hesitant because I’ve always wanted to become a flight attendant also.
		<sup>8</sup> However, due to the influence by one of my family member who is in the field of Information technology 
		I’ve decided to follow this path. <sup>9</sup> Spending my teenage years in Manila was indeed fun, I get to meet a 
		lot of people, attend multiple events and felt like I am slowly learning on my 
		own based on my experiences.<sup>10</sup><br>
		
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Teenage life was not all about fun and games or it 
		is just in my case that I have realized a lot of things already at this age. <sup>11</sup> I started searching for 
		my purpose and appreciated more the gift of life now that I understand how beautiful it is. <sup>12</sup> I also find 
		how valuable my family are because you would know that they are the only people who would stay beside you no matter 
		what and they indeed want only the best for you so always follow their advices.<sup>13</sup> Sometimes we cannot see 
		but the things that we want may not be the right thing for us and may hurt other people if we keep on chasing things 
		that is not meant for us. <sup>14</sup> I realized that we are not perfect, we are human and it is normal to make 
		mistakes. <sup>15</sup> What’s important is that we learn from it and it makes us become a better version of 
		ourselves.<sup>16</sup> Teenage years was crazy, it makes you feel all sorts of emotion that teaches you different 
		life lessons.<sup>17</sup> It is the stage of our lives when we don’t know if we should still act as a child or an 
		actual adult.<sup>18</sup> But again, it was amazing. <sup>19</sup> The life I’ve had during my teenage years and the 
		people that become a part of it is something that I would treasure forever.<sup>20</sup>

		<blockquote><p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the biggest challenge after graduating Senior High
		School is finding the school where you want to study college.<sup>1</sup> In my case I don’t have any dream school and
		it is not on any of my expectation that University of the East will be my chosen home for college. <sup>2</sup> As I 
		start my college journey, I am very excited because I know that there’s something big waiting ahead of me.<sup>3</sup> 
		Days goes by, several things would make you tired,it may be because of the traffic, the workload or the people that 
		surrounds you <sup>4</sup> During my 1st year days I was doubtful with myself and my chosen course.<sup>5</sup> I felt
		like programming is not for me and I was really thinking <q>what if it is really not for me?</q><sup>6</sup> I thought
		of shifting from IT to business course or something related to tourism. <sup>7</sup> There I realized how important it
		is to surround yourself with people who would motivate you and lift you up during those times.<sup>8</sup> My friends 
		kept on telling me that I should trust the process and I can slowly learn how to do it little by little.<sup>9</sup> 
		I learned that in college, it is really impossible to survive all on your own.<sup>10</sup><br>
		
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, we are now on our 2nd yr level and I am so happy 
		that the fire within me, the excitement I felt and my eager to learn is back once again.<sup>11</sup> This pandemic may
		have change the way we live as of the moment but I am still thankful that I found the reason to find a good reason in 
		it.<sup>12</sup> I realized that there’s a lot more opportunity in the IT field more than being a programmer.
		<sup>13</sup> I once again believe that everything is possible and that I can do it by enough perseverance.
		<sup>14</sup> That is why I can really tell that it is true, college will never be easy but we should learn how to 
		trust the process.<sup>15</sup> College has been the beginning of another chapter of my life.<sup>16</sup> It makes me
		feel that I’m one step close to achieving my dreams and living the best life I could ever give myself and continue
		making my parents proud of me<sup>17</sup> That is why no matter how hard it may be, just have the courage and
		faith to continue and everything else will fall into its place.<sup>18</sup> Aside from this, we never forget to take
		a rest once in a while because we all know that we deserve it.<sup>19</sup> I have nothing else to say but I am just 
		so excited to see what’s waiting ahead of me.<sup>20</sup>
